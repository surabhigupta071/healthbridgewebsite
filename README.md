# HealthBridge — Digital Bridge for Emergency Healthcare Access

## Project Overview
This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.  
To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

HealthBridge aims to improve emergency healthcare access by using a novel health patch scanning AI coupled with a volunteer-driven transportation network. Users can scan a medical patch that monitors key health indicators, and volunteers nearby can be alerted to provide urgent transport.

## What I Built
- The **project base was created using Firebase**, providing the foundational backend infrastructure like authentication, real-time data handling, and hosting.
- I **hand-coded the AI module that analyzes patch images** to detect color changes indicating health status (healthy, monitor, urgent).
- The AI patch analysis is fully custom and central to enabling health status detection from user-uploaded patch photos.

## Future Plans
- I will continue **adding more manually coded features** focused on volunteer coordination, location accuracy enhancement, user interfaces, and ride matching.
- The goal is to grow a fully custom, end-to-end solution built on top of the Firebase scaffold and AI capabilities.
- All added sections will showcase deeper manual coding and innovation to strengthen the project.

## Volunteer Recruitment Flyer
*(Flyer coming soon — will be added here once designed)*  
The flyer will help get volunteers onboarded by spreading awareness in local communities through posters, events, and outreach.

## How to Use
- Upload or simulate a patch image to see the AI health status analysis.
- Volunteer and ride coordination features will be progressively added.

## Acknowledgments
- Firebase for rapid backend setup.
- Hackathon organizers and community for support and inspiration.

This README will be updated regularly as more features are hand-coded and integrated.
